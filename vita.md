## Short Bio

I was born in Brazil, in a medium sized city called Sorocaba...

## Main Work Experience

### Analytic Projects Engineer at [Klabin S.A.](https://klabin.com.br/) (_May 2023 - Present_)
- I specialize in devising and implementing mathematical programming models to optimize industrial processes.
- From time to time, I deliver presentations on Analytics-related topics, including but not limited to Operations Research and Statistics.

### Assistant Professor at [Universidade Estadual Paulista](https://www.unesp.br/) (_August 2016 - Janyary 2022_)
- Taught the disciplines "Operations Research", "Probability and Statistics" and "Systems Simulation" at the Industrial Engineering undergraduate course at the Itapeva Campus.

### College Professor and Head of Department at [Faculdade de Engenharia de Sorocaba](https://facens.br/) (_August 2014 - July 2016_)
- Taught the disciplines "Calculus", "Linear Algebra", "Statistics" and "Operations Research" in undergraduate engineering courses.
- Restructured the contents of the engineering common core disciplines, enhanced the pre-calculus course, and implemented innovative teaching methodologies for freshman students.

### Research Assistant at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/) (_August 2009 - May 2014_)
- Collaborated on three articles published in esteemed journals within the field of Operations Research, including "Math Programming" and "Computers and Industrial Engineering," under the guidance of Professor Ismael de Farias, Jr. Made extensive use of CPLEX and Gurobi for solving instances of Mixed Integer Programming problems.

### Process Engineer and Production Manager at [Pilkington](https://www.pilkington.com/) (_January 2003 - May 2006_)
- Contributed to improving processes in automotive glass cutting, painting, and tempering lines.
- Oversaw the management of personnel, expenses, maintenance, and manufacturing operations for two glass production lines.

## Other Interests

I find great value on **Kaggle**, where I enjoy taking on challenges and sharing my solutions in notebooks. You can explore my contributions and journey on [my profile](https://www.kaggle.com/ekozyreff), which showcases my way of structuring code and explaining my problem-solving process.

I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/professorernee) where I teach about Operations Research (in Portuguese). The topics I cover include mathematical modeling, graphical solutions to small optimization problems, the Simplex method, and Branch-And-Bound.

One significant interest I have outside the scope of math is **Public Speaking**. Recognizing it as a pivotal skill, I dedicated time to overcoming initial challenges, transforming it from a weakness into a strength. Furthermore, I consolidated my learnings into a comprehensive public speaking course, which I conduct twice a year to help others develop this skill. I do it through [Spark Oratória](https://www.sparkoratoria.com/), a school I founded in 2021.

In 2022 I took a sabbatical year to pursue personal projects. Among them, I created the public speaking course mentioned earlier. Additionally, I traveled to Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina through [Worldpackers](https://www.worldpackers.com/) on a work exchange basis. That allowed me to immerse myself in different cultures, enhance my Spanish proficiency, and learn more about the world in general.
