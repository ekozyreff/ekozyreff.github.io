## Short Bio

I was born in Brazil, in a medium sized city called Sorocaba...


## Main Work Experience

#### Analytic Projects Engineer @ Klabin S.A. (_May 2023 - Present_)
- Together with the Analytical Projects team, I develop solutions for optimizing industrial processes using mathematical programming and statistical methods.

#### Assistant Professor @ Universidade Estadual Paulista (_August 2016 - Janyary 2022_)
- Taught the disciplines "Operations Research", "Probability and Statistics" and "Systems Simulation" at the Industrial Engineering undergraduate course at the Itapeva Campus.

#### College Professor and Head of Department @ Faculdade de Engenharia de Sorocaba (_August 2014 - July 2016_)
- Taught the disciplines "Calculus", "Linear Algebra", "Statistics" and "Operations Research" in undergraduate engineering courses.
- Along with the team of professors, we restructured the contents of the engineering common core disciplines, improved the pre-calculus course and introduced new teaching methodologies to freshman students.

#### Research Assistant @ Texas Tech University (_August 2009 - May 2014_)
- Co-authored three articles in highly prestigious journals in the area of Operations Research ("Math Programming" and "Computers and Industrial Engineering") under the supervision of Professor Ismael de Farias, Jr. Made extensive use of commercial solvers CPLEX and Gurobi for solving instances of Mixed Integer Programming problems.

#### Process Engineer and Production Manager @ Pilkington (_January 2003 - May 2006_)
- Worked on improvements in automotive glass cutting, painting and tempering lines.
- Was responsible for managing people, expenses, maintenance and manufacturing of two glass production lines
