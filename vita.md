# Short Bio

I was born in Brazil, in city called [Sorocaba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dd62pGTmhWDNdz2i6). Since a young age, I was drawn to math and sciences. When I was in high school, I spent a year as an exchange student in the US, where I lived with an American family and was a sophomore at [Miami Palmetto Senior High](https://www.palmettopanthers.org/). This experience was life changing because it gave me a greater perspective of the world.

I went on to study Engineering, Mathematics, Operations Research and, more recently, Machine Learning. Since my first internship, I have worked in technical, academic and managerial roles. Today my main focus is devising and implementing mathematical programming models to optimize processes at a major player in the paper industry.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and to podcasts, running, reading novels, watching movies and hanging out with friends.

# Main Experience

### Analytic Projects Engineer at [Klabin](https://klabin.com.br/) (_2023 - Present_)
- Developing solutions for optimizing industrial processes using mathematical programming and statistical methods.
- From time to time, I deliver presentations on Analytics-related topics, including but not limited to Operations Research and Statistics.

### Assistant Professor at [Universidade Estadual Paulista](https://www.unesp.br/) (_2016 - 2022_)
- Taught the disciplines "Operations Research", "Probability and Statistics" and "Systems Simulation" at the Industrial Engineering undergraduate course at the Itapeva Campus.

### College Professor and Head of Department at [Faculdade de Engenharia de Sorocaba](https://facens.br/) (_2014 - 2016_)
- Taught the disciplines "Calculus", "Linear Algebra", "Statistics" and "Operations Research" in undergraduate engineering courses.
- Restructured the contents of the engineering common core disciplines, enhanced the pre-calculus course, and implemented innovative teaching methodologies for freshman students.

### Research Assistant at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/) (_2009 - 2014_)
- Collaborated on three articles published in esteemed journals within the field of Operations Research, including "Math Programming" and "Computers and Industrial Engineering," under the guidance of Professor Ismael de Farias, Jr.
- Made extensive use of CPLEX and Gurobi for solving instances of Mixed Integer Programming problems.

### Math Teacher at High Schools (_2006- 2008_)
- Taught all areas of mathematics for high school students.

### Process Engineer and Production Manager at [Pilkington](https://www.pilkington.com/) (_2003 - 2006_)
- Contributed to improving processes in automotive glass cutting, painting, and tempering lines.
- Oversaw the management of personnel, expenses, maintenance, and manufacturing operations for two glass production lines.

### Intern at [Itaú](https://www.itau.com.br/) (_2002_)
- Worked on collecting data, building spreadsheets, and creating reports for senior management.

# Other Interests

I find great value on **Kaggle**, where I enjoy taking on challenges and sharing my solutions in notebooks. You can explore my contributions and journey on [my Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/ekozyreff), which showcases my way of structuring code and explaining my problem-solving process.

I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/professorernee) where I teach about **Operations Research** (in Portuguese). The topics I cover include mathematical modeling, graphical solutions to small optimization problems, the Simplex method, and Branch-And-Bound.

One significant interest I have outside the scope of math is **Public Speaking**. Recognizing it as a pivotal skill, I dedicated time to overcoming initial challenges, transforming it from a weakness into a strength. Furthermore, I consolidated my learnings into a comprehensive public speaking course, which I conduct twice a year to help others develop this skill. I do it through [Spark Oratória](https://www.sparkoratoria.com/), a school I founded in 2021.

In 2022 I took a **sabbatical year** to pursue personal projects. Among them, I created the public speaking course mentioned earlier. Additionally, I traveled to Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina through [Worldpackers](https://www.worldpackers.com/) on a work exchange basis. That allowed me to immerse myself in different cultures, enhance my Spanish proficiency, and learn more about the world in general.

My native language is **Portuguese**, and I am fluent in **English**. Additionally, I can communicate proficiently in **Spanish**.
