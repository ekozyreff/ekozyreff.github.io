# Short Bio

I was born in Brazil, in a city called [Sorocaba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dd62pGTmhWDNdz2i6). Since a young age, I have been drawn to mathematics and sciences, and went on to study Engineering, Operations Research, and, more recently, Machine Learning.

Today my main focus is on devising and implementing mathematical programming models to optimize processes at a major player in the paper industry.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and podcasts, running, reading novels, watching videos, and spending time with friends and family. 


# Professional Profile

I am an experienced Operations Research specialist with a strong academic background and a diverse professional history in both industry and education. My expertise lies in applying mathematical and statistical methods to practical challenges, utilizing tools like Python and optimization solvers. With a commitment to continuous learning and a proven track record in problem-solving, I aim to leverage my analytical skills to improve processes and enhance decision-making in dynamic environments.

# Other Interests

I find great value on **Kaggle**, where I enjoy taking on challenges and sharing my solutions in notebooks. You can explore my contributions and journey on [my Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/ekozyreff), which showcases my way of structuring code and explaining my problem-solving process.

I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/professorernee) where I teach about **Operations Research** (in Portuguese). The topics I cover include mathematical modeling, graphical solutions to small optimization problems, the Simplex method, and Branch-And-Bound.

One significant interest I have outside the scope of math is **Public Speaking**. Recognizing it as a pivotal skill, I dedicated time to overcoming initial challenges, transforming it from a weakness into a strength. Furthermore, I consolidated my learnings into a comprehensive public speaking course, which I conduct twice a year to help others develop this skill. I do it through [Spark Orat√≥ria](https://www.sparkoratoria.com/), a school I founded in 2021.

My native language is **Portuguese**, and I am fluent in **English**. Additionally, I can communicate proficiently in **Spanish**.
