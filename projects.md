# Professional Projects

### 1. Wood transportation planninng for paper production üå≤

My first major project at Klabin involved building a tool using Excel, VBA, Python, Pyomo, and CBC. At its core, it features an optimization model that minimizes deviations in the transportation of large quantities of wood used for paper production. A description of the project is available in [this repository](https://github.com/ekozyreff/wood_transportation_planning).


# Academic Projects

### 2. Minimizing the cycle lengh of a glass cutting machine üè≠

[This repository](https://github.com/ekozyreff/tpo_glass_cutting) has the Python code I used to generate and solve instances of a path minimization problem related to glass manufactoring. The description of the problem, theory behind it and computational tests are in a paper that is currently under revision. When published, I will post the link here.


### 3. Connections between Integer Programming and Neural Networks üî¢

[This code](https://github.com/ekozyreff/fischetti_jo_2018) is an implementation of some of the ideas presented in the paper "[Deep neural networks and mixed integer linear optimization](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10601-018-9285-6)", by M. Fischetti and J. Jo. It explores the use of Mixed Integer Programming to create adversarial examples for a Neural Network.


# Personal Projects

### 4. Kaggle's "Santa's Workshop Tour 2019" Competition ü•à

In [this repository](https://github.com/ekozyreff/kaggle_santa_2019) I'm sharing the Python code I used in the ["Santa's Workshop Tour 2019" Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/) and which granded me a silver medal.
