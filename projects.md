### 2. Minimizing the cycle lengh of a glass cutting machine üè≠

[This repo](https://github.com/ekozyreff/tpo_glass_cutting) has the Python code I used to generate and solve instances of a path minimization problem related to glass menufactoring. The description of the problema, theory behind it and computational tests are described in a paper that is currently under revision. When published, I will post the link to it here.


### 3. Connections between Integer Programming and Neural Networks üî¢

[This code](https://github.com/ekozyreff/fischetti_jo_2018) is an implementation in Python of some of the ideas described in the paper "Deep neural networks and mixed integer linear optimization", by M. Fischetti and J. Jo [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10601-018-9285-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10601-018-9285-6).

### 4. Kaggle's "Santa's Workshop Tour 2019" Competition ü•à

In [this repo](https://github.com/ekozyreff/kaggle_santa_2019) I'm sharing the Python code I used in the ["Santa's Workshop Tour 2019" Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/) and which granded me a silver medal.
