Here are some projects I have worked on in the past.

#### Connections between Integer Programming and Neural Networks
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ekozyreff/fischetti_jo_2018)

This code is an implementation of some of the ideas described in the paper "Deep neural networks and mixed integer linear optimization", by M. Fischetti and J. Jo [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10601-018-9285-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10601-018-9285-6).

#### Kaggle's "Santa's Workshop Tour 2019" Competition
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ekozyreff/kaggle_santa_2019)

In this repo I'm sharing the code I used in the ["Santa's Workshop Tour 2019" Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/).
